        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            A model for the propagation of long waves through broken ice of randomly-varying thickness covering the surface of water will be presented. When time-harmonic variations are considered the model, which involves depth-averaging through assumed shallow water, reduces to a simple 2nd order ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose coefficients encode the randomness of the ice cover. This ODE is analysed using a multiple scales approach in which ensemble averaging is performed carefully to eliminate fictitious decay due to phase cancellations not associated with multiple scattering. This results in a simple expression for the attenuation of waves (localisation) due to wave entering semi-infinite regions of randomness. These new theoretical predictions are supported by numerical results which use averaging of simulations of wave scattering over finite sections of random bathymetry for which transfer matrix eigenvalues are used to accurately measure decay. Agreement between theory and numerical results will be demonstrated. Comparisons are made with published field data for attenuation of waves in the marginal ice zones. Key features of the data are reproduced by theory including the attenuation being proportional to a power of frequency between 2 and 4 as well as capturing the "roll-over effect'' at high frequencies.

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            The Antarctic marginal ice zone (MIZ) is a crucial region of sea ice where floes break due to wave interaction and ocean-air interaction is enhanced. The extent of this zone has been difficult to detect directly, and a growing body of work shows that the traditional use of "$15$‚Äì$80$ sea-ice concentration" does not represent the MIZ well. We have little knowledge of the extent, seasonality or variability of the wave-affected MIZ. Laser altimetry has been used to map this region, but its retrieval suffers from cloud contamination. We show here a new technique to determine the wave-affected MIZ from AltiKa radar altimetry, which is insensitive to cloud cover, thus providing much more coverage. By this technique, MIZ retrieval has been fully automated, resulting in daily, spatially resolved time series of the Antarctic wave-affected MIZ for the first time, from 2013 to the present. The insights from this new dataset can be used to study trends and variability in the MIZ, and also for wave-ice interaction model tuning.

        <p align="center"> Abstract </p>
        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>The processes of generation, development, and propagation of spatial
                flexural-gravity waves are well studied now taking into consideration
                the case when a fluid in an undisturbed state is at rest or flows at
                constant speed. However, in real sea conditions, the vertical
                distribution of current velocity in some cases shows significant changes
                in magnitude and direction with the depth. This fact indicates that the
                study of flexural-gravity waves should be also carried out within the
                framework of such theoretical models that take into account the vertical
                structure of currents.</p>
            <p>In the present study, the behavior of an ice cover on the surface of
                an ideal incompressible fluid of finite depth under the action of a
                pressure domain that moves rectilinearly at constant velocity in the
                presence of a linear shear current in the near-surface layer is studied.
                The fluid flow is not potential. The ice cover is modeled by a thin
                elastic plate with account for uniform compression. The motion of a load
                can occur at an arbitrary angle to the direction of current. It is
                assumed that the ice deflection is steady in the coordinate system
                moving with the load. The Fourier transform method is used within the
                framework of the linear wave theory. The critical velocities, the
                deflection of ice cover and wave forces acting on a moving load are
                studied depending on the thickness of shear layer, the current velocity
                gradient, the direction of load motion, and the compression ratio of the
                ice cover.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>A theoretical model is used to study changes in water waves propagating
                into and through a region containing thin floating ice, for ice covers
                transitioning from consolidated (large floe sizes) to fully broken
                (small floe sizes). The degree of breaking is simulated by a mean floe
                length. It is shown that there are deterministic limits for consolidated
                and fully broken ice covers, in which the wave fields do not depend on
                the particular realisation of the floe field for a given mean floe
                length. The consolidated ice limit is consistent with classic
                flexural-gravity wave theory, and the fully broken limit is modelled by
                Bloch waves in a periodic floe field. The transition between the limits
                shows that the wave field depends on the floe field realization, as
                multiple wave scattering is a dominant process. The effects of the ice
                cover on the wave field are quantified using a wavelength, attenuation
                rate, and a transferred amplitude that represents the amplitude drop at
                the ice edge. It is shown that as the ice cover breaks up (mean floe
                size gets smaller), the wavelength decreases, the attenuation rate
                increases and the amplitude drop decreases (transferred amplitude
                increases). Dispersion relations are investigated in the consolidated,
                fully broken and transition regions, and compared to classic models. The
                results are consistent with physical models and provide a new
                interpretation of field observations.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>We present an advanced theoretical study of frequency downshifting in
                wavetrains propagating on the ocean surface covered by ice floes. Using
                the empirical model which suggests that small-amplitude surface waves in
                such an environment decay exponentially with the spatial rate depending
                on the frequency, ki ¬† w n, we derive the downshifting within the
                wavetrain described by the linear theory. We show that such downshifting
                appears due to the faster decay of high-frequency components compared to
                the low-frequency with no energy flux along the spectrum. The
                alternative weakly nonlinear model is considered within the framework of
                the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger (NLS) equation augment by the empirical
                dissipative terms. This model describes the propagation and decay of
                wavetrains in the form of envelope solitons and accounts for an energy
                flux along the spectrum down to lower frequencies. For the relatively
                small dissipation, we derive the frequency downshift in the solitons
                with the help of the asymptotic approach. The comparison of the
                downshifting obtained within the framework of linear and nonlinear
                models shows that in the latter case the frequency downshifting is
                notably less in comparison with the former case. In conclusion,
                estimates for the real oceanic conditions will be provided.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>There has been rising interest in ice shelf flexure produced by ocean
                waves due to a combination of recent theoretical studies and observed
                calving events. Current mathematical models that explore the flexure of
                ice shelves induced by ocean waves often employ a simplified uniform
                geometry, consisting of constant shelf thickness and seabed. Bennetts et
                al. (2022) introduced an efficient mathematical model of the
                wave-induced shelf flexure for the non-uniform geometry of the Ross Ice
                Shelf taken from the BEDMAP2 dataset. The results showed significant
                impact of shelf geometry and wave period on flexural strain.</p>
            <p> The
                presented study further investigates the impact of geometrical
                variations on shelf flexure. It extends the work of Bennetts et al.
                (2022) to multiple ice shelves, providing statistical relationships
                between shelf flexure and ice shelf thickness and seabed variation
                across the range of wave periods (swell, infra-gravity, and extremely
                long period waves).<br />

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>Studying the interaction between ocean waves and sea ice cover is
                essential for ensuring safety operations within the polar region and
                investigating the effects of climate change. However, while spectral
                wave modelling in open ocean areas has achieved high accuracy, modelling
                in the marginal ice zone remains challenging and is associated with
                relatively large errors. This challenge primarily stems from the limited
                availability of observations of waves in sea ice. In the present study,
                the wave-buoy analogy approach is applied to the extensive ship motion
                datasets collected during the cruises in the Southern Ocean to produce
                wave spectra estimates. By applying the transfer function called the
                response amplitude operator (RAO), the ship response spectrum can be
                translated into wave energy spectrum. The RAO is computed utilizing the
                ship hydrodynamic model NEMOH. The input includes the hull geometry with
                an estimated draft, as the actual draft is unavailable. The RAO is then
                calibrated by adjusting the draft and comparing the significant wave
                height of the measured wave spectra with the satellite altimeter
                observations, relying on the altimeter‚Äôs accuracy over open ocean, until
                the difference between them is minimised. The sea state parameters from
                the corrected spectra show good agreement with those from the ERA5
                reanalysis dataset. In the next step, wave attenuation is analyzed based
                on this database of wave spectra. Results show a power-law relationship
                between attenuation rate and frequency, which has been reported in
                several previous studies, and the power value we obtained is comparable
                to previous findings.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>Coastal polynyas are areas of open water enclosed by winter sea-ice in Antarctica.
                Polynyas significantly impact atmospheric, cryospheric and oceanic processes on different
                spatial and temporal scales. Very cold, local high-speed winds drive the sea-ice away from
                the coast, while at the same time intensifying the generation of new sea-ice. The associated
                brine rejection leads to formation of very dense shelf-water. This dense water mass
                eventually drives the global thermohaline circulation and ventilates the world‚Äôs deep ocean
                benthic eco-systems.</p>
            <p>For studying future climate, it is important to include the formation and the intense
                sea-ice production of coastal polynyas in global climate models. Currently they are not
                represented because the various polynya associated processes act on length scales below the
                resolution limit of global simulations.</p>
            <p>This project addresses two research questions using Machine Learning algorithms.
                First, how does the shape of local coastal topography promote or inhibit the occurrence of
                coastal polynyas. Second, how large-scale synoptic processes trigger and enhance local high speed winds under the influence of regional orography. In a two-stage approach, we first train
                a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using surface winds, coastline shape and sea-ice freeboard
                as input variables. Then, large-scale pressure and gradient wind variables will be added for
                training. The expected output from the RF-Classifier represents the binary prediction of
                polynya occurrence, the RF-Regressor predicts the area of polynyas. The overall objective is
                to predict polynyas using regional topography and large-scale atmospheric circulation only,
                thus avoiding the need to resolve local processes in climate models.</p>

            <p>The two-dimensional nonlinear problem of a steady flow in a channel
                covered by broken ice with an arbitrary bottom topography including a
                semi-circular obstruction is considered. The mathematical model is based
                on the velocity potential theory accounting for nonlinear boundary
                conditions on the bottom of the channel and at the interface between the
                liquid and the layer of the broken ice, which are coupled through a
                numerical procedure. A mass loading model together with a viscous layer
                model is used to model the ice cover. The integral hodograph method is
                employed to derive the complex velocity potential of the flow, which
                contains the velocity magnitude at the interface in explicit form. The
                coupled problem is reduced to a system of integral equations in the
                unknown velocity magnitude at the interface, which is solved numerically
                using a collocation method. Case studies are conducted both for the
                subcritical and for the supercritical flow regimes in the channel. For
                subcritical flows, it is found that the ice cover allows for generating
                waves with amplitudes larger than those that may exist in the free
                surface case; the ice cover prevents the formation of a cusp and extends
                the solution to larger obstruction heights on the bottom. For
                supercritical flow regimes, the broken ice significantly affects the
                waveform of the soliton wave making it gentler. The viscosity factor of
                the model apparently governs the wave attenuation.</p>

            <p>Hydroelastic wave propagation in an ice-covered channel for the
                compressed ice cover has been investigated. The channel has a
                rectangular cross-section. The fluid in the channel is inviscid,
                incompressible and covered with ice. The ice is modeled as a thin
                elastic plate. Cases of ice compression along the channel and across the

            <p>Methods for obtaining dispersion relations and determining critical
                velocities with the help of normal modes for uniform non-compressed
                plates have been developed. The problem is reduced to the problem of the
                wave profiles across the channel. The solution to the considered problem
                is obtained in the form of a series of the vibration modes of an elastic
                beam without compression; see [1-3]. It is shown that phase velocities

                For compression across the channel, the existence of two modes with the

            <p>Linear hydroelastic waves propagating in an ice channel are
                investigated. The ice thickness is constant along the channel and
                variable across the channel. The channel is a rectangular cross-section
                with finite depth and infinite extent. The liquid in the channel is
                inviscid and incompressible. The liquid flow caused by the ice
                deflection has potential. The ice is modeled by a thin elastic plate
                clamped to the channel walls. The coupled hydroelastic problem is
                reduced to the problem of the wave profiles across the channel. The wave
                profiles are sought as a series of normal dry modes of the plate, the
                coefficients of which are to be determined. The dispersion relations of
                these hydroelastic waves, their phase speeds, and their profiles across
                the channel are determined.</p>
            <p>Two cases of variation in the ice thickness are considered. The first
                case is symmetric linear change with respect to the centre of the
                channel. The second case is an arbitrary shape of the ice thickness. In
                both cases, the method of construction of the normal dry modes are
                presented. In the first case the solution is obtained in the form of a
                series of Bessel functions using symmetry of the wave profiles. The
                normal modes of the plate with an arbitrary thickness are calculated
                using piecewise linear approximation of the plate thickness. These modes
                are such that the corresponding deflections, slopes, bending stresses
                and shear forces are continuous. The modes are presented by Bessel
                functions in the intervals, where the plate thickness is linear, and by
                trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, where the thickness is

            <p>This study is about wave-ice interactions in the marginal ice zone
                (MIZ). We compare simulations using recent three-dimensional
                formulations for wave-ice interactions and the scattering of ocean
                surface waves by flexible ice floes, with older parameterizations and
                field observations. These parameterizations are implemented in a modern
                version of the wave model WAVEWATCH III¬Æ, as source terms in the action
                balance equation. Field observations consist of wave characteristics
                collected during the Arctic Sea State Boundary Layer Experiment of 2015
                in the Beaufort Sea. Comparisons focus wave heights, 1-dimensional and
                2-dimensional wave spectra and wave attenuation as the waves propagate
                into the MIZ. Results show that the new wave-ice formulations for
                wave-ice interactions provide an improvement compared to previous
                parameterizations, in the simulations of observation cases. Test cases
                include collinear winds and waves, and crosswinds to the waves,
                propagating into the MIZ.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>The attenuation of ocean surface waves in seasonal sea ice and resulting
                sea ice motion is challenging to observe with conventional methods using
                sparse mooring or buoy arrays. A novel method for persistent observation
                of wave-ice interactions using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) along
                seafloor fiber optic telecommunication cables is applied to 36-km
                cross-shore cable in the Alaskan Arctic on the Beaufort Shelf. DAS
                optical sensing of fiber strain-rate provides a proxy for seafloor
                pressure, which we calibrate with wave buoy measurements during the
                ice-free season (August 2022). This calibration is applied to the ice
                formation season (November 2021) to obtain unprecedented resolution of
                variable wave attenuation rates in new, partial ice cover. The rapid
                evolution of the location and strength of attenuation serves as proxy
                for the evolution of ice coverage and thickness, especially during
                rapidly evolving events. Results suggest that higher attenuation rates
                previously observed near the ice-edge may be a result of wave-ice
                interactions leading to ice compaction and increased thickness. Such
                high-resolution estimates of wave attenuation will contribute to better
                understanding the range of wave attenuation coefficients appropriate for
                different ice types and thicknesses, and implementation in coupled
                wave-sea ice models.</p>

            <p>The two-dimensional unsteady problem of a rigid cylinder moving
                vertically in a liquid covered by an elastic thin plate of infinite
                extent is studied. The liquid is incompressible and inviscid. The flow
                caused by the body motion is potential. Deflections of the elastic plate
                are assumed small compared with the radius of the cylinder. The boundary
                condition on the plate/liquid interface is linearised and imposed on the
                initial equilibrium level of the plate. It is shown that the problem is
                coupled for impulsive motions of the body and decoupled if the body
                acceleration is moderate. The coupled problem is solved using the
                conformal mapping of the flow region onto a ring and the method of
                separation of variables applied to both the hydrodynamic and structural
                parts of the problem. This study is restricted to the constant speed of
                the cylinder motion towards the ice plate. The effect of the nonlinear
                term in the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the plate/liquid interface
                on the response of the ice plate is also investigated.</p>

            <p>We present an update on an ongoing effort to measure ocean surface waves
                and sea ice in the central Beaufort Sea of the western Arctic. The time

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>Recent decades have seen a rise in ocean engineering research on the interaction between surface gravity waves and large floating structures. Wave-ice interaction in cold region science and technology is another field of investigation. Both problems consider the structures to be thin, homogenous, isotropic flexible plate. The hydroelastic properties of these structures are explored by analyzing flexural gravity waves resulting due to the interaction of surface gravity waves with the large floating structures. Furthermore, ocean currents, which occur in virtually every region of the ocean, contribute to the complexity of the issues. Recent research pertaining to wave-structure interaction problems has revealed the phenomenon of wave blocking, which occurs due to the interaction between flexural gravity waves and ocean current. The interaction leads to the existence of multiple propagating wave modes within certain frequency limits, which vary with the speed of the current.</p>
            <p>
                In this study, flexural gravity waves interact with shear current having constant vorticity within the blocking limit to form triads in finite water depth with compressive force. Triad formations are explored geometrically using Ball's diagram for different compressive force and current speed values. The study assumes small amplitude water wave theory and homogeneous fluid structure response for finite water depth. This study shows that at least three triads occur for certain frequencies within the blocking limits, depending on co-current/counter-current interaction with flexural gravity waves, compressive force, and current speed.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>The study of ocean wave propagation through floating ice sheets has
                gained significant attention owing to its relevance in the polar
                region‚Äôs science and technology. Further, various geophysical processes,
                viz., upwelling, wind stresses and geothermal effects, could have a
                notable impact on ice sheets in polar regions. Besides, there are open
                water unfrozen areas within the ice-covered ocean known as polynyas,
                which are created in areas where the ice motion is divergent because of
                the prevailing winds or oceanic currents. It is interesting to know the
                interaction of flexural gravity waves outside these polynyas with the
                surface gravity waves within these polynyas. Of particular interest is
                the phenomenon of wave blocking, a distinctive characteristic associated
                with the propagation of flexural gravity waves. This phenomenon unveils
                the presence of multiple propagating wave modes within specific periods
                under the influence of lateral compressive forces. Recent studies on
                flexural gravity waves have unveiled that wave blocking occurs when the
                group velocity reaches zero while the phase velocity remains positive
                for distinct periods. In the present analysis, the scattering of
                flexural gravity waves by a circular polynya within the regime of wave
                blocking is studied in finite water depth. The Fourier-Bessel series
                expansion is employed to determine the velocity potential for single and
                multiple propagating wave modes within the ice sheet. The study further
                investigates the influence of various hydrodynamic and structural
                parameters on the scattered wave field, wave elevation within the
                polynya, and the strain rate experienced by the ice sheet.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>In the past few decades, a significant progress is observed in the study
                on surface gravity wave interaction with large floating ice sheets or a
                large-scale ice floes stripped from the ice sheet in the marginal ice
                zone (MIZ) due to rise in global temperature as well as global warming.
                In most of the studies, large floating ice sheets are considered as an
                infinitely extended thin floating elastic plate, however, due to strong
                wind, high waves and temperature variation the ice sheets in the
                marginal ice zone behaves like fractured ice. Furthermore, the study on
                wave-ice interaction problems becomes more complex with the inclusion of
                the role of ocean current. Since, the dispersion curve loses its
                symmetricity about the axes and as a result for each frequency
                two-distinct wavenumbers exists.</p>
            <p>The present study deals with the surface gravity wave propagation in
                the presence of current in which the ice sheet is considered as
                fractured ice under the assumption of linearized theory of water waves
                and small amplitude structural response. Emphasis is given to
                investigate numerically the floe size distribution of a large scale ice
                floe in the presence of current in a water of infinite depth. The
                simulative study is based on CFD-DEM method in which volume of fluid
                (VOF) method is used to simulate the water phase and discrete element
                method (DEM) is considered to model the large scale floating ice. In
                addition, a probability distribution, namely, Weibull distribution is
                considered for analyzing floe size distribution (FSD). The impact of
                wave-current field on a large-scale floating ice in established based on
                a two and three dimensional wave numerical model. The study reveals that
                the fracture length changes with a change in the current, which is due
                to the change in wavelength for the same frequency. Additionally, the
                presence of current causes the drift motion of the ice sheets. Moreover,
                it is observed that the size distribution of fractured ice is uniform in
                the case of following current, whilst the same becomes concentrated in a
                small scale range in the case of opposing current. Additionally, the
                averaged normalized size of the broken ice increases/decreases in the
                presence of following/opposing current. This is because of the fact that
                wavelength increases (decreases) as the wave propagates in the same
                (opposite) direction of current.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the linearized theory of water waves, we examine a model that
                delves into the scattering of oblique waves by obstacles. The obstacles,
                in this case, take the form of thin multiple surface-piercing porous
                barriers characterized by non-uniform porosity. The study is conducted
                within the context of a flexible ocean bed of uniform finite depth. The
                flexible base surface is represented as a thin elastic plate, relating
                to the Euler‚ÄìBernoulli beam equation. Employing the eigenfunction
                expansion method and mode-coupling relations, we derive four
                Fredholm-type integral equations from the boundary value problem. To
                solve these integral equations, multi-term Galerkin approximations are
                applied using Chebyshev polynomials multiplied by appropriate weight

                algebraic equations. The system is then solved numerically, and
                important parameters such as reflection, transmission, dissipation
                coefficients, shear force, and strain are computed and presented
                graphically. It has been found that as the bottom-standing porous
                structure‚Äôs length, width, porosity, and friction factor grows, the
                transmission coefficient decreases and the dissipation coefficient
                rises, which helps in diminishing the wave impact on the elastic
                plate.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>Flexural gravity waves are generated due to the interaction of surface
                gravity waves with a floating flexible plate. These waves are the result
                of the interplay between gravitational forces and elastic bending,
                making them distinct from conventional surface gravity waves. In coastal
                environments as well as in polar regions, the interactions of flexural
                gravity waves with bottom steps and submerged breakwaters are of
                significant importance. The recent study on blocking dynamics of
                flexural gravity waves has revealed the existence of multiple
                propagating wave modes for certain frequency and lateral compressive
                force, whilst major studies on flexural gravity wave transformation are
                limited to single propagating wave. Besides, the higher-order boundary
                condition on the ice-covered ocean surface in wave-ice interaction
                problems add additional challenges since the vertical eigenfunctions
                involving flexural gravity waves are not orthogonal in the classical
                sense. In this presentation, flexural gravity wave scattering due to
                step type undulated sea bed is studied in the case of multiple
                propagating waves. The method is extended to the case of a submerged
                rectangular breakwater and trenches using geometrical symmetry. The
                orthogonal eigenfunctions associated with surface gravity waves are used
                to develop a system of equations in the eigenfunction expansion method
                involving the flexural gravity wave problem, which is found to be much
                easier than the use of the orthogonal mode-coupling relation associated
                with flexural gravity waves. The energy balance relation is obtained to
                account for multiple propagating wave mode and is used to validate the
                computational result. Various numerical results will be presented to
                demonstrate the effect of multiple propagating waves in the context of
                wave blocking.</p>
